# Gravity Jump

This is Gravity Jump. It is a cross-platform game written primarily for mobile devices (Android/iOS), it uses the cocos2dx library and is written in C++.
The game is an infinite scolling game, using proceedrul generation in order to create the level. The parts of the levels are created with different chunks.
I have integerated metrics and achievements within the game, keeping track of various players scores and details as they play. This was going to be develoepd seperately into a metrics library that can be used to track players behaviours within different apps.
I used Googles Mocking framework to test the game during development. 

It is currently an alpha, so expect some quirks.

# Features

- Procedural Level Generation
- Multi-platform
- Achievements and Tracking metrics system

# TODO

As an alpha game, the following features are being worked on and implemented:
- Different platform types


# Getting Started

You can download the installer in the release section to play it on Windows (Arrow key controls). You can also download the Android APK file to play it on your mobile device.

## Installing from source (Local)

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have all the below installed:

- A C++ compiler (Either Visual Studio or Code::Blocks for Windows)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)
- [Cocos2dx 2.1.5 library](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/cocos2d-x/cocos2d-x-2.1.5.zip)

If using Visual Studio, you must first compile cocos2dx and add the project under the 'projects' folder. It currently works on 2.x versions of cocos2dx, but 2.1.5 is the most stable. 
# Alpha Version

Currently, Gravity Jump is in an alpha stage so expect some bugs! :) Android releases have not been tested on all devices.
